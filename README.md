# Java-Simplex-Noise-Algorithm-Program-2D-3D-4D
A Java program that runs the Simplex Noise algorithm. Feel free to use this for whatever you want.

This is a java program that runs the Simplex Noise algorithm. You can change the colors by going into the 'OpenSimplexNoiseTest' class
and change the rgb value to whatever color you want. The program supports 2D, 3D, and 4D, so this is applicable to pretty much anything.
There are no licsenses for this program, so feel free to use it commercially or for one of your personal projects. The program outputs the
noise into a .png file, but that can be easily changed, so keep that in mind.
